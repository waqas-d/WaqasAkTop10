Peer review comments: Nice site! I really like the layout using the cards, it's very simple, but effective, and it's clean. The descriptions are nice and brief. All of the video links work, but I think it would be better if they opened up in new tabs.
Responsiveness isn't quite there yet. The cards get a little wonky as you scale down the screen dimensions and the title text and main menu button aren't always centered. When I change the screen dimensions to tablet size, things get worse. It would be cool if the cards stacked on top of one another in a vertical list when the screen is sized down. You should also add alt text to your images. Otherwise I really like the style of the website!
